# Lab1C-Processing-Exercises
Some basic processing exercises and an example. 

## Includes
- Float vs. int declaration
- global variables
- variables instead of hardcoding
- documenting code
- changing size & shape based off of a scalar. 

## Exercise 
1. In `1AC-*YOUR FIRST NAME*-*YOUR LAST NAME*`, start a processing document. 
2. In the comment section at the top, include the lab number, your name, and a description of what you are drawing.
3. Set up your canvas (size & color). Add any extra default settins here.
4. Draw & fill a shape, placing it somewhere specific on the canvas. Comment it
5. Pick one part of the definition of the shape, not of the location. 
If it's an ellipse, choose at least one radius. 
If it's a rectangle or triangle, one leg. 
Define it in terms of global variables.
Comment those.
Run code to make sure everything still works.
6. Add a scalar global variable. Comment. Scale the shape with every run through draw.
7. Make a color changing scalar, and change the color with every run through draw. 
If the last scalar was a float, make this one an int and vice versa
8. Play with the variables. Get comfortable. Have fun with it. Turn in an example you are proud of. Can use multiple shapes.

## Example Submission
[Lab 1AC Example Submission](https://github.com/UMaine-NMD-211-Fall-2020/Lab1AC-ExampleFolder) - it has a typo 
in the processing file's comments, but apart from that, should work as a reference
